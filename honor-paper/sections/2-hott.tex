\section{The Homotopical Structure of Type Theory}\label{sec:hott}

In this section we give the basic idea of HoTT 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Martin-\Lof's identity types as path spaces
    \item The Hofmann-Streicher groupoid interpretation
    \item n-types and truncation: from sets to âˆž-groupoids
    \item Transport and path induction as homotopical operations
\end{enumerate}
