\begin{definition}
    Let $f,g:\prod_{(x:A)}P(x)$ be two dependent functions.
    The type of \emph{homotopies} from $f$ to $g$ is defined as
    \[
        f\sim g\Defeq \Prod_{(x:A)}f(x)=g(x)
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{fiber bundle} structure on a space $E$, with fiber $F$, consists of a projection map $p: E\to B$ such that each point of $B$ has a neighborhood $U$ for which there is a
    homeomorphism $h:p^{-1}(U)\to U\times F$ making the following diagram commute
    \begin{figure}
        \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large,column sep=huge]
            p^{-1}(U) \arrow[r, "h"] \arrow[dr, "p"'] & U\times F \arrow[d, "\pi_1"] \\
            & U
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{figure}
\end{definition}

The fiber bundle structure is determined by the projection map $p:E\to B$,
but to indicate what the fiber is we sometimes write a fiber bundle as $F\to E\to B$,
a `short  exact sequence of spaces'.
The space $B$ is called the \emph{base space} of the bundle, and $E$ is the \emph{total space}.

% A map p : E  →  B is said to have the  homotopy lifting property with respect to a space X if, given a homotopy g  t  :X  →  B  and a map   ̃  g  0  :X  →  E lifting g  0  , so p   ̃  g  0  =g  0  , then there exists a homotopy   ̃  g  t  :X  →  E  lifting g  t  . From a formal point of view, this can be regarded as a special case of the  lift extension property for a pair (Z, A) , which asserts that every map Z  →  B has a  lift Z  →  E extending a given lift defined on the subspace A ⊂ Z . The case (Z, A) =  (X × I, X × {0}) is the homotopy lifting property.

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{fibration} is a map $p:E\to B$ having the homotopy lifting property with respect to all spaces $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{contractible type} is a type which has, up to identification, only one term.
