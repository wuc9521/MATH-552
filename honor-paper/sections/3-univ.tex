\section{Univalence: The Core Homotopical Axiom}\label{sec:univalence}

In this section we mainly talk about the univalence axiom in HoTT.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Informal meaning: equivalent types are equal
    \item Topological motivation: homotopy equivalence and its role
    \item Consequences of univalence for mathematics
    \item Comparison with traditional foundations
\end{enumerate}
